# Center-HTML-Textarea-Caret

This is a way to center vertically a HTML textarea caret when writing in that textarea.

That means that the caret will be centered when you are writing.

It's done by calculating the height of the line and applying a scrollTop based on the current line position

Tested only on Chrome 53.

NOTE: to work the text in the textarea needs to turn off wrap. If not, it won't work as the lines in the textarea are no the same as the lines in the text.
